# Report-DATA-ANALYSIS-Insurance-Claim-Analysis
This repository presents a data analysis project based on an insurance claims dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains demographic and health-related information and is used to investigate the relationship between individual health indicators and insurance claim amounts.

The analysis is conducted using the statistical programming language **R** and follows a structured exploratory and multivariate approach.

This study utilizes a comprehensive dataset encompassing demographic and health information derived from insurance claims, available on Kaggle. The dataset includes variables such as age, gender, BMI, blood pressure, presence of chronic diseases like diabetes, smoking status, region, and insurance claim amounts. These variables provide a rich basis for examining the intricate relationships between health indicators and insurance claims.

The primary objective is to employ the statistical programming language R to conduct a thorough exploration of the dataset. The analysis comprises:

- **Univariate Analysis**: This step involves examining the distribution and key statistics of individual variables to understand their characteristics.
- **Multivariate Analysis**: This stage focuses on exploring the relationships between multiple variables simultaneously to uncover potential interactions and correlations.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, facilitating the identification of principal components that explain the maximum variance.
- **Clustering Analysis**: This method is used to identify natural groupings within the data, thereby uncovering hidden patterns and insights.
